            My Goals!
        </h1>
        <h2> What are my goals?</h2>
        <p>While I work my way through school, I would like to learn how to create and design games. After I graduate, I would like
            to work for a game company and create games for many people to enjoy. Another option would be to do independent game
            development and work on my own games and create my own game ideas. Eventually I might even create my own company and 
            create a team of other enthusiastic game devs and create games that are big and wonderful and entertaining!

        <h2>What I'm Going To Do To Reach My Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Over time, I will learn how to use game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity. These engines are great tools for game
            development as they are commonly used in the game community. I also hope to learn what makes design. I'm interested in
            creating the story and the elements that users experience and I think by creating many examples of it, I will learn how
            to design very well when I eventually make full games. I will work piece my piece until I have full finished products!
