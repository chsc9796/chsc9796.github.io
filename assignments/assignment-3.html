        Star Wars is an American epic space opera multimedia franchise created by George Lucas, 
        which began with the eponymous 1977 film[b] and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. 
        The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, 
        video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing 
        fictional universe. In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the 
        fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled 
        Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and 
        Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the 
        series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack 
        of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company 
        to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of 
        Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of 
        Skywalker (2019). All nine films of the "Skywalker Saga" were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going 
        to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action "anthology" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo 
        (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, which makes it the 
        second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[3][4] Additional upcoming films are in the works, 
        including an untitled movie from Taika Waititi planned for 2023 and Rogue Squadron directed by Patty Jenkins, 
        which currently does not have a release date.

        <p>
            The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away",
            in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to 
            in the films as 'droids'), who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is 
            common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology. The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide 
            cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, 
            has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.
            The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae. 
            Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations such 
            as the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, 
            and HoloNet (internet counterpart). 
        </p>
            The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to ours but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative 
            stories. One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as "an energy field
            created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together". The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.
            Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, 
            precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy). It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.
            The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the
            Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the
            dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths')
            are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice. Another notable fictional element of Star Wars is
            hyperspace, an alternate dimension that allows faster-than-light travel.
        <p>
            Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon
            called a lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of 
            the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms. As a result of galaxy-scaled 
            politics (involving republics, empires, kingdoms, alliances, etc.), all this weaponry is made use of in various military 
            conflicts during which most Star Wars material takes place. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as 
            the Hutt cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments. Illicit activities 
            include smuggling and slavery.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            The combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes Star Wars a very universal franchise, capable of telling 
            stories of various genres.

            <h3>The Skywalker Saga</h3>
                <h4>The Original Trilogy</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not 
                    obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera. After directing American 
                    Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.
                    By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay. The 1977 movie's success 
                    led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial. With the backstory he created for the 
                    sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies. Most of the main cast 
                    would return for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were self-financed 
                    by Lucasfilm. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope 
                    in the 1979 book The Art of Star Wars. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 
                    21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, Episode VI: 
                    Return of the Jedi was released on May 25, 1983. The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke 
                    Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent Darth Vader, and the 
                    struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire.
                </p>

                <h4>The Prequel Trilogy</h4>
                <p>
                    According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining 
                    of the original two films. In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, 
                    but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981. 
                    In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... 
                    As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and 
                    I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery 
                    (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that
                     the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive." In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the 
                     prequel trilogy. A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "updated" the 20-year-old films 
                     with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Episode I: The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, and Episode II: Attack of the Clones on May 16, 
                    2002. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the first PG-13 film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005. 
                    The first two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. 
                    The trilogy begins 32 years before Episode IV and follows the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, 
                    and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well as the corruption 
                    of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth Sidious. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas 
                    has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".

                <h4>The Sequel Trilogy</h4>
                <p>[REDACTED]</p>

                <h3>Anthology Films</h3>
                <p>
                    Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the Star Wars anthology 
                    series (though the word anthology has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional 
                    "A Star Wars Story" subtitle). Focused on how the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans introduced in the 1977 
                    film, the first anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, was released on December 16, 2016, to favorable 
                    reviews and box office success. The second, Solo: A Star Wars Story, centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca 
                    and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018, to generally favorable reviews and 
                    underperformance at the box office. The television series Obi-Wan Kenobi was originally going to be a film 
                    instead but changed to a limited series due to Solo underperforming. Despite this, more anthology films are 
                    expected to be released, following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker.

        <p>
            The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture, with references to its fictional universe deeply 
            embedded in everyday life. Phrases like "evil empire" and "May the Force be with you" have become part of the 
            popular lexicon. The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, enjoyed by a wide spectrum of 
            people. The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
            making science-fiction films a mainstream genre. The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works 
            and homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken: 
            Star Wars. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U.S. 
            National Film Registry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." The Empire Strikes 
            Back was selected in 2010, and Return of the Jedi was selected in 2021. 35mm reels of the 1997 Special 
            Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the 
            original prints, but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the 
            original theatrical releases.
