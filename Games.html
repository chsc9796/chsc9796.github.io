        <p>
          Barble Mlast was my first real game where I didn't follow any specific tutorials on how to make it. I did it as part of
          a game jam over thanksgiving 2021 and while it got really challenging at some points when I couldn't figure out how
          to make components work, I had a great time actually putting together a game and I can't wait to do it again!
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is a parody of Marble Blast, a platformer game where you play as a marble and have to get from the start to the finish.
          Designing the levels was really fun as I got to make up a lot of different ideas like moving platforms and tunnels and get
          inspiration from things in real life like the American Ninja Warrior obstacle course.
