        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, I'm Charlie! I'm currently a sophmore at The University of Colorado Boulder. I am majoring in Creative Technology
            and Design and planning on Minoring in Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also the co-leader of the Game Development and Graphics Club!
            After I graduate. I want to work for a game company like Respawn, Epic, and many others. My dream is to make video games
            for a living and see the joy it brings to peoples lives as it has to my own!
        </p>
        <p>
            While I currently don't have many games in my portfolio (one), I want to take this year and learn how to design and develop
            and make a portfolio that stands out! I am currently trying to work in Unity and Unreal Engine 5
        </p>

            <h4>Tennis</h4>
            <p>
                I am also starting to play tennis at least once a week. It's been one of my greatest sports since I was 
            little and after not playing for a while I realized how much I really love the sport.
