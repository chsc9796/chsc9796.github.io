        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, I'm Charlie! I'm currently a sophmore at The University of Colorado Boulder. I am majoring in Creative Technology
            and Design and planning on Minoring in Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also the co-leader of the Game Development and Graphics Club!
            After I graduate. I want to work for a game company like Respawn, Epic, and many others. My dream is to make video games
            for a living and see the joy it brings to peoples lives as it has to my own!
        </p>
        <p>
            While I currently don't have many games in my portfolio (one), I want to take this year and learn how to design and develop
            and make a portfolio that stands out! I am currently trying to work in Unity and Unreal Engine 5
        </p>

            <h4>Guitar</h4>
            <p>
                I try to practice guitar once a day but it's hard to get time in with school work but I make do! I'm starting to find 
                songs that I want to learn on guitar and learning those. It's a difficult process but I think in the end it will all be
                worth it.

            <h4>Tennis</h4>
            <p>
                I am also starting to play tennis at least once a week. It's been one of my greatest sports since I was 
            little and after not playing for a while I realized how much I really love the sport.
            </p>

        <section id="Skateboard">
            <h4>Skateboard</h4>
            <p>
                I skateboard to class everyday. I don't leave my house without it! It's my mode of transportation. I have a
                meepo v4s board which is a longboard style board and can go 18 miles! Not that I have gone a whole 18 miles
                but the board I had before (meepo mini 2) could only go 11 miles MAX and the farthest I've gone on my current is 15 miles
                so it's a big difference.

            <h4>Video Games</h4>
            <p>
                I love playing video games whether with friends or by myself. I play games like Minecraft, Sea of Theives,
                War Thunder, and Battlefield. All of which I can play by myself or with friends. I love how games create worlds
                that I would never be able to live in in real life but can with a couple clicks.
